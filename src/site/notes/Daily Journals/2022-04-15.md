# Daily Note
## Morning DUMP:
> "How many have laid waste to your life when you weren't aware of what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief, foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements‚Äîhow little of your own was left to you. You will realise you are dying before your own time!"
> - Seneca, [[Everything Else/On the Shortness of Life|On the Brevity of Life]], 3.3b


Life is short. Actually life is not short, its just that we are wasting most of it. To appease people, we tend to say "Yes" when all we want to say no. Saying no is so hard because you want to fit in. It is even harder when you try to say no to your emotions. Negative ones take over your life and destroy your time. They are commitments from the moment you feel them to the time you manage to calm the storm. 

Time spent is a time you can never get back. Life is overwhelming with the constant looming threat of death. [[Everything Else/Memento mori|Memento mori]]. But you shouldn't let that worry you. Sometimes you should say no. It can hurt people but you are prioritising yourself and your time in this world. The more you say no to the things you don't want to do‚Äî the things that don't matter. You say yes to the things that bring you happiness, the ones that brings you an eternal life.
